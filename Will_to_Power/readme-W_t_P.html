  <p><strong> Beta 0.8 </strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod endeavors to add a psionics system to the BG games which uses completely new  mechanics.  It is experimental, doing things that the game engine was not really designed for.  But in play it should give you a new king od character with new kinds of abilities.  I have no idea how it is balanced, power-wise, against the game's traditional warrior and magic-using classes... let's find out! :)</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have a "will_to_power" folder and "setup-will_to_power.exe" in your game folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-will_to_power.exe" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Run setup-might_and_guile.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a folder called "will_to_power," a file called "weidu," and the "Mac WeiDU Launcher" in your game directory. To install, simply double-click the WeiDU Launcher, choose "Will_to_Power" from the list, and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will to Power is designed to work with the Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine games in the 2.<i>x</i> series of patches.  (So, not PSTEE.)</p>
  <p>This mod should be compatible with almost all other popular mods.  It is at heart a kit mod, adding three kits to the game and unique game mechanics for those kits to use, without affecting other classes or kits or game mechanics.</p>
  <p><strong>Install Order:</strong><br />
    Honestly I'm not really sure yet.  With other thief kit mods - say, after Rogue Rebalancing but before Might & Guile.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component 100: </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>The WtP Psionics System</em></strong></p>
      <p> In the Forgotten Realms you may commonly find magic users, who use words and gestures to harness, control, and shape external energies that infuse the world.  A psion, on the other hand, learns to harness, control, and shape the energy that infuses his own being.  The ability to utilize that energy results from a combination of long study, intense meditation, and rigorous physical conditioning.  Through that training, a psion develops the ability to expand his mind past the limits of his body.  With experience, he may perform great feats of strength, manipulate energy, move objects, or touch others' minds.  While this seems supernatural, for a skilled psion it is no different from the way he uses his mind to lift his arm, or move his legs to walk.</p>
	  <p>Of course, hard running and heavy lifting take a toll on the body, and psionics is no different.  Just as muscles contain stores of chemical energy that can be depleted, only to be recharged by rest and eating, so do psionic powers temporarily utilize stored biological energy.  In-game, this is represented by a temporary reduction in your maximum hit points. 
	  <ul>
		<li>Example 1: a low-level psion with 10 hit points has been struck by a dagger, and now has 8 left.  He decides to put some space between himself and his attacker, using Project Force.  The stated cost of Project Force is 4 max hp.  The target is knocked down and flung away; the psion is reduced from 8/10 hp to 4/6 hp.  He will regenerate 1 hp every 12 seconds, until he is back to 8/10 hp 8 rounds after using Project Force.
		<li>Example 2: that same psion next faces an Enchanter and wants to protect himself against mental attacks by raising a Mind Ward.  The stated cost of Mind Ward is 4 max hp, just like Project Force, but Mind Ward is a <i>maintainable</i> power.  The psion can raise the Ward and his hp will drop to 4/6; and they will stay that way as long as he maintains the protection.  After the magical threat is gone he can cancel the Mind Ward, and from that point his max hp will be restored over 8 rounds.
	  </ul>
	  <p>That's right: there are no PSPs in this mod.  I couldn't figure out a good way to do it.  Moreover, 2E-style PSPs only regenerate when you rest (sort of), so playing a psion with PSPs would be not much different from playing a sorcerer.  Using health and allowing it to regenerate makes the gameplay associated with the class more unique and interesting compared to the vanilla classes.  (It also makes game balance difficult to get just right, so I will happily listen to critiques from players about how this actually works in the game.)  The convenient thing is, your hp go up as you level, which means your store of psionic power will automatically go up as well.  Now, psionic effects will tend to be noticeably weaker than the magic spells used by a spellcaster of a similar level.  Likewise,  psionic attacks may be weaker than the melee attacks of a warrior of a similar level.  However, a psion has a flexibility unmatched by warrior or wizard:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Compared to the warriors, a psion may create pseudo-superhuman effects to react to the circumstances: hardening his skin to resist physical damage, or shoving dangerous enemies out of weapon range, or superheating the edge of his weapon to make it more deadly.  
		<li>Compared to spellcasters, a psion is not bound by the limits of memorization.  As long as his body can continue to recharge his stores of energy, he can use his abilities indefinitely.  And while it takes several seconds for spellcasters to clear their magical aura and cast again, a psion may use powers at will, only slightly slowed down by the mental fatigue of using them in rapid succession.  (In game terms, psionic powers have a 'casting time' of 1 and behave as if the player has Improved Alacrity active; but the use of each power induces a +2 penalty to casting time for one round, so their use become progressively slower if you use them quickly.)
      </ul>
    <p><strong><em>The WtP Psionic Powers</em></strong></p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Mind Ward:</b> the psion erects a minor barrier against mental attacks, be they magical or psionic in nature. It protects against Charm/Domination, Sleep, Hold, and Fear effects.  A Mind Ward only protects against one such attack; after that it will be canceled. The cost to maintain this protection is 4 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Id Insinuation:</b> this ability attacks the target's subconscious, causing the target to either go mad with fear, or go berserk and attack the nearest being, for 3 rounds unless they make a save with a -1 penalty. At 6th level the save penalty increases to -2, and at 12th level it increases to -3. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Ego Whip:</b> this ability induces lethargy and despair in the target, resulting in a 2-point penalty to saving throws for one turn. If the target fails a save, they also suffer a 2-point penalty to thac0 and weapon speed, and a 1-point penalty to Luck and casting time. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Cerebral Repair</b> this ability removes the effects of fear, sleep, feeblemindedness, unconsciousness, and intoxication, as well as berserk and confused states of mind. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Mental Domination:</b> this ability allows a psionicist to take over the mind of a humanoid for up to 10 rounds. The target is dominated for 3 rounds unless they make a saving throw; for 7 rounds after that, the target can save once each round to try to break the domination. At 6th level the save is rolled with a -1 penalty, and at 12th level the penalty increases to -2. The cost is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Intellect Fortress:</b> the psion erects a powerful mental defense against all mental attacks, be they magical or psionic in nature. It protects against Charm/Domination, Sleep, Hold, Fear, Confusion, Feeblemind, Stun, and Maze effects. The cost to maintain this protection is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telepathy - Psychic Crush:</b> this ability initiates a powerful mental attack, stunning a target creature for 3 rounds and doing 4d3 psychic (stunning) damage unless the target makes a saving throw with a -2 penalty (which avoids the stun effect and halves the damage). At 12th level the save penalty increases to -3 and the damage increases to 4d4, and at 18th level the save penalty increases to -4 and the damage increases to 4d6. The cost is 9 hit points.</li><br />
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Project Force:</b> this ability blasts a target with powerful but unfocused telekinetic energy, causing 2d3 stunning damage and, upon a failed saving throw, knocking the target back 5 feet. Additionally, this ability has a 50% chance to break open locks. At 6th level the damage is 2d4 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 2d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 4 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Immobilize:</b> the target of this power is held frozen in place, unable to move or act, upon a failed saving throw. On the second round and each round thereafter, up to ten rounds, an immobilized target may attempt another save to escape the effect. Even if a save is made, the target is very briefly Slowed while fighting off the telekinetic control. At levels 6 and 12, the target's saving throw is rolled with a -1 and -2 penalty, respectively. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Inertial Barrier:</b> this ability creates a movable barrier inches from the psion's skin, which has several protective effects: it provides a +2 bonus to AC and 40% damage resistance against crushing and missile attacks; a +1 AC bonus and 20% damage resistance against slashing attacks; 25% resistance to fire, acid, and magic damage; and immunity to the Magic Missile spell. The cost to maintain the Barrier is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Psychic Knife:</b> the psion can focus telekinetic energy into a razor-sharp blade emanating from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This force can be wielded like a sword, as if the rogue had Mastery (+++) in its use, doing 1d4 slashing damage and 1d4 magic damage.  At 12th level, the blade is wielded as if with Grandmastery. The cost to maintain the Psychic Knife is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Repulsion:</b> this ability creates an unfocused surge of telekinetic force which throws anyone nearby away from the psion (except allies, who can be shielded from the effect), unless they make a saving throw vs. Breath. While the ability is maintained, this surge of force builds and is released once per 3 seconds. The cost to maintain the repulsion effect is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Free Action:</b> this ability allows the psion to break free of any bonds; and to avoid being caught or held by any effect that affects <PRO_HISHER> mobility. Such spells or events will fail to affect the psion as long as this ability is maintained. The cost to maintain free Action is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Telekinesis - Mass Immobilize:</b> all enemies within 20' of the psion are held frozen in place, unable to move or act, upon a failed saving throw. On the second round and each round thereafter, up to ten rounds, each immobilized target may attempt another save to escape the effect. Even if a save is made, the target is very briefly Slowed while fighting off the telekinetic control. At levels 6 and 12, the target's saving throw is rolled with a -1 and -2 penalty, respectively. The cost is 9 hit points.</li><br />
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Static Discharge:</b> this ability is similar to the Shocking Grasp wizard spell. The psion collects static electricity in his hand, and then uses it to attack an enemy. The enemy takes 2d4+1 points of damage, and must make a saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. At 6th level the damage is 3d4+2 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 4d4+3 and the save penalty increases to -2. The cost is 4 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Molecular Agitation:</b> this ability causes the molecules on the edge of the psion's weapon to to become so excited that they can ignite material with which they make contact. The functional result is that all successful melee attacks made by the psion do 1d6 points of heat damage in addition to the normal weapon damage. The cost to maintain the ability is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Energy Dispersion:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion instinctively absorbs and deflects harmful energies. <PRO_HISHER> resistance to energy-based damage (fire, cold, electricity, and magic damage) is set to 60%. The cost to maintain the barrier is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Psychic Combustion:</b> this ability allows the psion to spontaneously create a brief but powerful fire in any location. The flames do 3d4+3 fire damage to all enemies within 5 feet of the point of combustion. At 6th level the damage increases to 4d4+4, and at 12th level the damage increases to 5d4+5. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Solar Flash:</b> this ability creates an intense ray of radiant energy in a 20-ft. radius around the psion. All enemies within the area of effect take 2d4 points of heat damage and must save vs. petrification with a -1 penalty or be blinded for 4 rounds.  At 12th level the saving throw penalty increases to -2, and at 18th level it increases to -3. Undead that are hit by the solar flare take double damage. The cost is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Freezing Precipitation:</b> this ability removes heat energy from an area at a prodigious rate.  Snow and ice will precipitate out of the air and beings in the area of effect will suffer 2d4 points of damage per round from the cold, for four rounds. Additionally, beings in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. Breath Weapon each round they remain in the area or have their movement rate halved for that round. The cost is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Pyrokinesis - Generate Lightning:</b> after taking a few moments to collect static energy from the surrounding area, the rogue can discharge it as violent lightning energy. The lightning strikes a chosen target and arcs to any other enemies within 10 feet (the psion has some measure of control over the energy and can protect <PRO_HISHER> companions). The discharge does 2d6 lightning damage, which is halved upon a successful saving throw. At 6th level the damage is 3d6 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty. At 12th level the damage is 4d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 9 hit points.</li><br />
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Adrenaline Rush:</b> this ability causes the rogue's physical stats to increase by 1-3 for 4 rounds, followed bythis ability temporarily boosts the psion's strength by 2 points and increasing <PRO_HISHER> movement and attack speed, for 3 rounds. Afterward, the psion becomes tired and weakened (-4 to STR) for 2 rounds. At 6th level the Strength bonus is increased to +3 and lasts 4 rounds; and at 12th level it is increased to +4 and lasts 5 rounds. The cost is 4 hit points, and the ability may not be used again until the weakness has worn off.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Body Purification:</b> This ability removes all toxins from the body, both natural and magical in nature. It immediately neutralizes any poison and will also cure any diseases that the psion might be suffering from, as well as blindness and deafness. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Bioregeneration:</b> this ability triggers powerful healing responses in the psion's immune system, resulting in the regeneration of 1 hit point per round. This is a maintainable power; the psion can all such healing to fully take its course; however, the psion must concentrate on the power, and may not engage in physical combat while the power is maintained. At 6th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points every 2 rounds, and at 12th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points per round. The cost to maintain the regeneration is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Chemical Simulation:</b> this ability allows the psion to secrete a toxic liquid and direct it at a nearby enemy. This attack does 2d3 poison damage, plus 1 point per round for 5 rounds (the initial damage is halved and the ongoing damage is avoided if the target makes a save vs. Poison.  At 6th level the damage increases to 2d4, +2/round; and at 12th level it increases to 2d6, +3/round. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Absorb Infliction:</b> this ability allow the psion to sacrifice his own bodily health in order to heal an ally. If the psion's current hit points are greater than the ally's, then the difference between the two values will be subtracted form the psion and added to the ally. Additionally, the ally may be cured of inflictions such as poison, disease, blindness and deafness. The psion takes on such ailments, and immediately performs a Body Purification, purging them from <PRO_HISHER> own body. The cost is 9 hit points, and the strain of such healing increases the psion's level of fatigue.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Camouflage:</b> this ability makes the psion's body blend into the nearby environment like a chameleon. The effect is similar to the Improved Invisibility spell, although it does not actually involve invisibility: the psion has a -4 bonus to AC, a +40% bonus to stealth, and cannot easily be targeted by spellcasters. The cost to maintain the Camouflage is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Biokinesis - Carapace:</b> this ability causes the rogue's skin to harden into a fast-regenerating, strong but brittle shell. This provides a -2 bonus to AC, and harmlessly absorbs 1 physical attack each round. The cost to maintain the Carapace is is 9 hit points.</li><br />
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Object Reading:</b> once per day, out of combat, the psion may determine the history and nature of am item or weapon.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Insightful Strike:</b> while maintained, the next attack made by the psion will automatically be a critical hit. The cost to maintain this ability is is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Instinctive Luck:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion's foresight and intuition give <PRO_HIMHER> 1-point bonus to Luck, which results in a 5% bonus to to-hit rolls, saving throws, rogue skills, and melee damage, as well as a 10% bonus to skill checks. The cost to maintain this ability is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Sensory Dissociation:</b> upon activate this ability, the psion is able to view a distant area.  After using the ability, click on a section of the map that you want to view. For five rounds, the psion can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications. The cost is 6 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Life Detection:</b> this ability allows the psion to detect intelligent thought around them. This makes invisible creatures visible to and targetable by the psion, but not by anyone else (unless they have their own means of seeing through invisibility). Note, this *does* function against undead, golems, and similar constructs; even those animated beings have rudimentary cognition sufficient to impart motor control - and it is that cognitive process which can be detected. The cost to maintain this ability is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Danger Sense:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion has a 3-point bonus to Armor Class, a 25% bonus to the Find Traps skill, and cannot be backstabbed. Further, if the psion encounters certain magical and environmental effects that can be dodged, <PRO_HESHE> may attempt a saving throw vs. Breath Weapon to avoid the effect altogether. The cost to maintain this ability is is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Clairsentience - Precognition:</b> this ability gives the psion a vague glimpse into dangers and challenges that <PRO_HESHE> and <PRO_HISHER> allies may face in the immediate future. The Psion and all allies within range of easy communication can benefit from this information, receiving a 1-point/10% bonus to thac0, AC, saving throws, and skill checks for the next two turns. The cost is 9 hit points.</li><br />
