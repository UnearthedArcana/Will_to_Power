  <p><strong> 1.3 </strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod endeavors to add a psionics system to the BG games which uses completely new  mechanics.  It is experimental, doing things that the game engine was not really designed for.  But in play it should give you a new king of character with new kinds of abilities.  I have no idea how it is balanced, power-wise, against the game's traditional warrior and magic-using classes... let's find out! :)</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have a "will_to_power" folder and "setup-will_to_power.exe" in your game folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-will_to_power.exe" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Run setup-might_and_guile.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>MacOS:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a folder called "will_to_power," a file called "weidu," and the "Mac WeiDU Launcher" in your game directory. To install, simply double-click the WeiDU Launcher, choose "Will_to_Power" from the list, and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Will to Power is designed to work with the Enhanced Edition Infinity Engine games in the 2.<i>x</i> series of patches.  (So, not PSTEE.)</p>
  <p>This mod should be compatible with almost all other popular mods.  It is at heart a kit mod, adding three kits to the game and unique game mechanics for those kits to use, without affecting other classes or kits or game mechanics.</p>
  <p><strong>Install Order:</strong><br />
	Probably it should be after most other kits. Like maybe immediately before Might & Guile. (Kits installed after WtP will not have a chance to be Wild Talents.)</p>
  <p><strong>Modder Resources:</strong><br />
	Will to Power adds three custom spellstates to SPLSTATE.IDS.  It uses stat 33, "Tracking," to track PSPs, and will conflict with mods that use that stat in ways that are not limited to a kit or power. (My 'Mana Sorcerer' mod also uses the tracking stat, but it is fully compatible with Will to Power.)</p>
</div>
<h2>Component 100: </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>The WtP Psionics System</em></strong></p>
      <p> In the Forgotten Realms you may commonly find magic users, who use words and gestures to harness, control, and shape external energies that infuse the world.  A psion, on the other hand, learns to harness, control, and shape the energy that infuses his own being.  The ability to utilize that energy results from a combination of long study, intense meditation, and rigorous physical conditioning.  Through that training, a psion develops the ability to expand his mind past the limits of his body.  With experience, he may perform great feats of strength, manipulate energy, move objects, or touch others' minds.  While this seems supernatural, for a skilled psion it is no different from the way he uses his mind to lift his arm, or move his legs to walk.</p>
	  <p>Of course, hard running and heavy lifting take a toll on the body, and psionics is no different.  Just as muscles contain stores of chemical energy that can be depleted, only to be recharged by rest and eating, so can psionic powers temporarily utilize stored biological energy.  In-game, this is represented by a temporary reduction in your maximum hit points. </p>
	  <p>What this means in-game is that you will have a store of PSPs which can fuel your abilities; when you exhaust your PSPs, you can still use psionic powers but doing so will sap youir 'max hit points' value. This will recover over time... slowly - one hit point per two rounds.</p>
	  <p>Psionic powers have a 'casting time' of 1 and behave as if the player has Improved Alacrity active, so unlike magic users you can use powers more than once per 6 seconds. However, the use of each power induces a +2 penalty to casting time for one round, so their use become progressively slower if you use them too quickly.)</p>
    <p><strong><em>Wild Talents</em></strong></p>
      <p> This mod introduces a small chance that any playable character might have some latent psionic abilities, even if they are not in a psion class. Joinable NPCs will have an innate "check for Wild Talent" ability. Upon using this innate, there is a ~5% chance that the NPC will discover the ability to use a random psionic devotion from one of the five disciplines; there is a ~1% chance they will be able to use a science; and there is a ~1% chance they will be able to use two psionic powers. There is a ~94% chance that nothing happens.</p>
    <p>As a demonstration of how this works, Haer'Dalis will automatically be a Wild Talent, getting one power from a select group.
    <p><strong><em>The WtP Psionic Powers</em></strong></p>
    <p><b>Telepathy</b><p/>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Devotion - Mind Ward:</b> the psion erects a minor barrier against mental attacks, be they magical or psionic in nature. It protects against Charm/Domination, Sleep, Hold, and Fear effects.  A Mind Ward only protects against one such attack; after that it will be canceled. The cost to maintain this protection is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Sensory Synchronization:</b> the psion connects the minds of a group of allies, enabling them to work very efficiently together and anticipate each others actions and the perceived actions of enemies.  This give each affected ally a -2 Armor Class bonus.  At 6th level this increases to a -3 bonus, and at 12th level the affected allies also do more damage in melee and take less damage from spells targeting them. The cost to maintain this effect is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Id Insinuation:</b> this ability attacks the target's subconscious, causing the target to either go mad with fear, or go berserk and attack the nearest being, for 4 rounds unless they make a save with a -1 penalty. At 6th level the save penalty increases to -2, and at 12th level it increases to -3. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Ego Whip:</b> this ability induces lethargy and despair in the target, resulting in a 2-point penalty to saving throws vs. enchantments and telepathy for one turn. If the target fails a save, they also suffer a 2-point penalty to thac0 and weapon speed and all other saving throws, and a 1-point penalty to Luck and casting time.  The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Cerebral Repair:</b> this ability removes the effects of fear, sleep, feeblemindedness, unconsciousness, and intoxication, as well as berserk and confused states of mind. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Mental Domination:</b> this ability allows a psionicist to take over the mind of a humanoid for up to 10 rounds. The target is dominated for 3 rounds unless they make a saving throw; for 7 rounds after that, the target can save once each round to try to break the domination. At 6th level the save is rolled with a -1 penalty, and at 12th level the penalty increases to -2. The cost is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Intellect Fortress:</b> the psion erects a powerful mental defense against all mental attacks, be they magical or psionic in nature. It protects against Charm/Domination, Sleep, Hold, Fear, Confusion, Feeblemind, Stun, and Maze effects. The cost to maintain this protection is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Psychic Crush:</b> this ability initiates a powerful mental attack, stunning a target creature for 3 rounds and doing 3d4 psychic (stunning) damage unless the target makes a saving throw with a -2 penalty (which avoids the stun effect and halves the damage). At 12th level the save penalty increases to -3 and the damage increases to 4d4, and at 18th level the save penalty increases to -4 and the damage increases to 4d6. In addition, there is a 50% chance that this ability will remove the protection of Chaotic Commands, Mind Blank, Exaltation, and similar spells. The cost is 10 points.</li>
	  </ul>
    <p><b>Telekinesis</b><p/>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Project Force:</b> this ability blasts a target with powerful but unfocused telekinetic energy, causing 1d8 stunning damage and, upon a failed saving throw, knocking the target back 5 feet. Additionally, this ability has a 50% chance to break open locks. At 6th level the damage is 1d10 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 2d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Enhanced Mobility:</b> this ability allows the psion to break free of any bonds; and to avoid being caught or held by any effect that affects <PRO_HISHER> mobility. This is not quite as powerful as the magic of a Free Action spell; but the psion will be able to evade  spells or events that hinder <PRO_HISHER> movement 60% of the time, as long as this ability is maintained. The cost to maintain this ability is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Immobilize:</b> the target of this power is held frozen in place, unable to move or act, upon a failed saving throw. On the second round and each round thereafter, up to ten rounds, an immobilized target may attempt another save to escape the effect. Even if a save is made, the target is very briefly Slowed while fighting off the telekinetic control. At levels 6 and 12, the target's saving throw is rolled with a -1 and -2 penalty, respectively. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Inertial Barrier:</b> this ability creates a movable barrier inches from the psion's skin, which arrests the momentum of objects striking the psion. The barrier provides a +3 bonus to AC and 40% damage resistance against crushing, missile, and fire attacks; a +1 AC bonus and 20% damage resistance against slashing and acid attacks; and immunity to the Magic Missile spell. At 6th and 12th level, the AC bonuses and damage resistances increase by 1 and 10%, respectively. The cost to maintain the Barrier is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Psychic Knife:</b> the psion can focus telekinetic energy into a razor-sharp blade emanating from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This force can be wielded like a sword, as if the psion were Specialized (++) in its use, doing 1d4 slashing damage and 1d4 stunning damage.  At 6th level the blade is wielded as if with Mastery (+++), and at 12th level the blade is wielded as if with Grandmastery (+++++). The cost to maintain the Psychic Knife is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Detonate:</b> with this ability, the psion releases the latent kinetic energy in solid material like stone and metal, within a small (5') radius. The forceful blast pushes all creatures away from the central point of the area of effect, and can knock them down on a failed saving throw, and does 2d8 points of force damage (save for half). At 6th level, the saving throw is made with a -1 penalty and the damage increases to 3d8; at 12th level the saving throw is made with a -2 penalty and the damage increases to 4d8. Creatures made of inanimate material, like golems and skeletons, are particularly vulnerable to the blast and take twice the base damage. The cost is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Material Animation:</b>  with this ability, the psion can focus <PRO_HISHER> telekinetic energy on a mass of stone, dirt, and other nearby debris. The construct takes on roughly humanoid shape, and can be controlled by the psion and fight on <PRO_HISHER> direction, for one turn. The cost to animate the construct is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Mass Immobilize:</b> all enemies within 20' of the psion are held frozen in place, unable to move or act, upon a failed saving throw. On the second round and each round thereafter, up to ten rounds, each immobilized target may attempt another save to escape the effect. Even if a save is made, the target is very briefly Slowed while fighting off the telekinetic control. At levels 6 and 12, the target's saving throw is rolled with a -1 and -2 penalty, respectively. The cost is 10 points.</li><br />
	  </ul>
    <p><b>Pyrokinesis</b><p/>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Static Discharge:</b> this ability is similar to the Shocking Grasp wizard spell. The psion collects static electricity in his hand, and then uses it to attack an enemy. The enemy takes 2d4+1 points of damage, and must make a saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. At 6th level the damage is 3d4+2 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty; at 12th level the damage is 4d4+3 and the save penalty increases to -2. The cost to maintain the charge is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Solar Flash:</b> this ability creates an intense ray of radiant energy in a 20-ft. radius around the psion. All enemies within the area of effect take 1d6 points of heat damage and must save vs. petrification with a -1 penalty or be blinded for 2 rounds.  At 12th level the saving throw penalty increases to -2, and at 18th level it increases to -3. Undead that are hit by the solar flash take double damage. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Molecular Agitation:</b> this ability causes the molecules on the edge of the psion's weapon to to become so excited that they can ignite material with which they make contact. The functional result is that all successful melee attacks made by the psion do 1d6 points of heat damage in addition to the normal weapon damage. The cost to maintain the ability is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Energy Dispersion:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion instinctively absorbs and deflects harmful energies. <PRO_HISHER> resistance to energy-based damage (fire, cold, electricity, and magic damage) is set to 50%. At 6th level this increases to 65%, and at 12th level it increases to 75%. The cost to maintain the barrier is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Psychic Combustion:</b> this ability allows the psion to spontaneously create a brief but powerful fire in any location. The flames do 3d4+3 fire damage to all enemies within 5 feet of the point of combustion. At 6th level the damage increases to 4d4+4, and at 12th level the damage increases to 5d4+5. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Energy Modulation:</b> this ability allows the psion to mentally control the flow of energy in the nearby environment. Allies will do 50% more damage with energy-based attacks, while enemies will find such attacks dampened, doing 50% less damage. The cost to maintain the modulation is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Freezing Precipitation:</b> this ability removes heat energy from an area at a prodigious rate.  Snow and ice will precipitate out of the air and beings in the area of effect will suffer 2d4 points of damage per round from the cold, for four rounds. Additionally, beings in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. Breath Weapon each round they remain in the area or have their movement rate halved for that round. The cost is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Generate Lightning:</b> after taking a few moments to collect static energy from the surrounding area, the rogue can discharge it as violent lightning energy. The lightning strikes a chosen target and arcs to any other enemies within 10 feet (the psion has some measure of control over the energy and can protect <PRO_HISHER> companions). The discharge does 2d6 lightning damage, which is halved upon a successful saving throw. At 6th level the damage is 3d6 and the save is rolled with a -1 penalty. At 12th level the damage is 4d6 and the save is rolled with a -2 penalty. The cost is 10 points.</li><br />
	  </ul>
    <p><b>Biokinesis</b><p/>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Adrenaline Rush:</b> this ability temporarily boosts the psion's strength by 2 points and adds 8 to the psion's maximum hit points; both effects last three rounds. Afterward, the psion becomes tired and weakened (-4 to STR) for 2 rounds while catching <PRO_HISHER> breath. At 6th level the Strength bonus is increased to +3 and the hit point boost increases to +10, and the effects last four rounds; at 12th level the Strength bonus is increased to +4 and the hit point boost increases to +15, and the effects last four rounds. The cost is 6 points, and the ability may not be used again until the weakness has worn off.</li>
	    <li> <b>Metabolic Acceleration:</b> this ability allows the psion to drastically speed up <PRO_HISHER> biological processes for a short time. For 5 rounds <PRO_HISHER> movement speed will be doubled and <PRO_HESHE> will be able to perform one extra physical attack per round. This lasts for five rounds, after which the psion returns to a normal pace of life. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Body Purification:</b> this ability removes all toxins from the body, both natural and magical in nature. It immediately neutralizes any poison and will also cure any diseases that the psion might be suffering from, as well as blindness and deafness. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Bioregeneration:</b> this ability triggers powerful healing responses in the psion's immune system, resulting in the regeneration of 1 hit point per round. This is a maintainable power; the psion can all such healing to fully take its course; however, the psion must concentrate on the power, and may not engage in physical combat while the power is maintained. At 6th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points every 2 rounds, and at 12th level the psion regenerates 3 hit points per round. The cost to maintain the regeneration is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Chemical Simulation:</b> this ability allows the psion to secrete a toxic liquid and direct it at a nearby enemy. This attack does 2d3 poison damage, plus 1 point per round for 5 rounds (the initial damage is halved and the ongoing damage is avoided if the target makes a save vs. Poison.  At 6th level the damage increases to 2d4, +2/round; and at 12th level it increases to 2d6, +3/round. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Empathic Transference:</b> this ability allow the psion to sacrifice his own bodily health in order to heal an ally. If the psion's current hit points are greater than the ally's, then the difference between the two values will be subtracted form the psion and added to the ally. Additionally, the ally may be cured of inflictions such as poison, disease, blindness and deafness. The psion takes on such ailments, and immediately performs a Body Purification, purging them from <PRO_HISHER> own body. The cost is 10 points, and the strain of such healing increases the psion's level of fatigue.</li>
	    <li> <b>Visual Camouflage:</b> this ability makes the psion's body blend into the nearby environment like a chameleon. The effect is similar to the Improved Invisibility spell, although it does not actually involve invisibility: the psion has a -4 bonus to AC, a +40% bonus to stealth, and cannot easily be targeted by spellcasters. The cost to maintain the Camouflage is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Dermal Carapace:</b> this ability causes the psion's skin to harden into a fast-regenerating, strong but brittle shell. This provides a -2 bonus to AC, and harmlessly absorbs 1 physical attack each round. The cost to maintain the Carapace is is 10 points.</li><br />
	  </ul>
    <p><b>Clairsentience</b><p/>
	  <ul>
	    <li> <b>Object Reading:</b> by concentrating on an item, the psion may arrive at an understanding of its history and function. This is particularly effective with items that have been enchanted, with a result similar to the Identify spell. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Aura Evaluation:</b> with this ability the psion can read the aura of a creature, to determine the target's strengths and weaknesses. For two turns, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against the target creature are made with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. The ability has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. The cost is 6 points.</li>
while maintained, the next attack made by the psion will automatically be a critical hit. Upon making such a strike, the power will automatically be canceled. The cost to maintain this ability is is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Instinctive Precognition:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion's foresight and intuition give <PRO_HIMHER> 1-point bonus to Luck, which results in a 5% bonus to to-hit rolls, saving throws, rogue skills, and melee damage, as well as a 10% bonus to skill checks. The cost to maintain this ability is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Remote Observation:</b> upon activate this ability, the psion is able to view a distant area.  After using the ability, click on a section of the map that you want to view. For five rounds, the psion can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications. The cost is 6 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Fate Link:</b> using this ability, the psion extends <PRO_HISHER> aura and connects with other creatures in the vicinity, in a manner particularly attuned to pain and violence. Whenever a nearby creature harms the psion - even with a ranged weapon - the resulting feedback causes that creature to suffer 1d6 nonlethal damage. The cost to maintain the link is 10 points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Life Detection:</b> this ability allows the psion to detect intelligent thought around them. This makes invisible creatures visible to and targetable by the psion, but not by anyone else (unless they have their own means of seeing through invisibility). Note, this *does* function against undead, golems, and similar constructs; even those animated beings have rudimentary cognition sufficient to impart motor control - and it is that cognitive process which can be detected. The cost to maintain this ability is 9 hit points.</li>
	    <li> <b>Danger Sense:</b> while this ability is maintained, the psion has a 3-point bonus to Armor Class, a 50% bonus to the Find Traps skill, cannot be backstabbed, and can avoid one missile attack each round. Further, if the psion encounters certain magical and environmental effects that can be dodged, <PRO_HESHE> may attempt a saving throw vs. Breath Weapon to avoid the effect altogether. The cost to maintain this ability is is 10 points.</li><br />

<h2>Component 999: </h2>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Allow Multiclass Clerics to Use More Weapons</em></strong></p>
    <p>Since psionic development uses the Cleric class as a template, as a technical matter all psions operate as multiclass clerics in the game.  The only problem is that clerics are by default bound by an ethos that precludes using pointed or edged weapons, and psions are not supposed to have any such restriction. If you install this component, is will liberalize which weapons can be used by <i>ALL</i> multiclass clerics, and liberalizes the proficiencies available <i>only</i> to the psion classes:
      <ul>
    	<li>Fighter/clerics will be able to equip any weapons normally usable by fighters; unkitted fighter/clerics and Soulblades will be able to specialize in any weapons that paladins can.</li>
    	<li>Ranger/clerics will be able to equip any weapons normally usable by rangers; unkitted ranger/clerics and Psyphers will be able to specialize in any weapons that rangers can.</li>
    	<li>Cleric/thieves will be able to equip any weapons normally usable by clerics <i>or</i> thieves; unkitted cleric/thieves and Psionicists can be proficient in any of the same set of weapons as thieves.</li>
    	<li>Cleric/mages will be able to equip any weapon normally usable by clerics <i>or</i> mages; unkitted cleric/mages can be proficient in any of the weapons that clerics or mages can.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>This of course will have implications for no-psionic class in your game; it is completely optional, and you can instead just play psions with blunt weapons. Your choice of course. This component will not ba available if you have already installed the armor/weapon usability changes from Faiths & Powers; in that case the pionic kits will use the FnP system to be able to use a variety of pointed and edged weapons.</p>
